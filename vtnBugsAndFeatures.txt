Vocab Tester N:

    Give it a TUI
    Yes before No in 'getyesorno'

Potential improvements:

    getc returns int, but return value is stored as char, leading to potential EOF error. Fix.
    vocabfuzzysearch is case sensitive, could be changed with tolower() or toupper().
    Test is currently (by design) case sensitive. An option could be added to make it case insensitive.
    scanf, as used in vocabfuzzysearch is hideously unstable, and can cause unexpected results or crashes if a letter or other unexpected input is entered. Could be replaced with proper validation function.
    Can the separate while loops at lines 648 and 654 be combined using 'substringlength++'?
    if the default and most recently loaded databases are the same, the user is effectively asked the same thing twice
