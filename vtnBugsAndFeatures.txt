Vocab Tester N:

Potential improvements:

    vocabfuzzysearch is case sensitive, could be changed with tolower() or toupper().
    Test is currently (by design) case sensitive. An option could be added to make it case insensitive.
    Can the separate while loops at lines 789 and 795 be combined using 'substringlength++'?
    Use ncurses forms library where appropriate
    In the 'Sorry, the correct answer is:' popup, an extra newline has been added as a workaround because otherwise the correct answer was not shown if the answer was shorther than the phrase 'The correct answer is:'. This could be fixed at considerable effort.
